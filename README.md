# Android MVP
Sample project using MVP Clean architecture. The purpose of this first version was not to show beautiful animations/interfaces but to implement Model-View-Presenter architecture and use some interesting libraries and technologies.
In this project you will learn : 

 - How to work with RecyclerView and the new Toolbar hiding and showing it when the user scrolls down/up
 - How to use dagger 2.0 framework and work with dependency injection 
 - How to work with REST Json using Retrofit library
 - To use picasso in order to download and modify images
 - To avoid duplicated code using ButterKnife <br/>
And many more things :D <br/>

**Upcoming changes to next version:**

 - New animations and interface improvements (Material Design)
 - New mapper. It will map the information from the repository to domain
 - Thread implemetation instead of otto bus
