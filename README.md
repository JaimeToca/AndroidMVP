# Android MVP
Sample project using MVP Clean architecture (check out the diagram at the bottom) . This small app show a list of the most famous hollywood actors (retrieve from themoviedb.org), when any of them is clicked a new screen will be opened with detailed information about the specific actor. Libraries and technologies used in this project:

 - Model-View-Presenter Pattern
 - RxJava/ReactiveX
 - Coordinator Layout, Toolbar (Hide/show) , RecyclerView and some material design features.
 - Dagger 2.0 framework and dependency injection 
 - Retrofit (REST Client for android/java)
 - Picasso in order to download and modify images.
 - ButterKnife to avoid duplicated code <br/>
And many more things :D <br/>
